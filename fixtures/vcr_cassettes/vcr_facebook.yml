        and Learn is a new tool for Facebook advertisers that relies on deeper analytics
        to help you better understand the overall effectiveness of your advertising.\n\nThe
        primary reason for this is that it leverages Conversion Lift. For example...\n\nFacebook
        will create two test groups:\n\n1. Those who saw your ads during the test.\n2.
        Those in your target audience who were held back from seeing your ads during
        the test.\n\nSometimes, people in the second group would have converted without
        seeing your ads anyway (warm audiences, in particular). Additionally, someone
        may convert within the test period after seeing your ad, but fall outside
        of the default attribution window.\n\nFor these tests, Facebook really only
        cares about who saw your ads, who didn''t, and how many conversions happened
        from both groups to determine overall conversion lift. It''s more complicated
        than that, but in the simplest terms.\n\nTake a look at my detailed tutorial.

        of understanding how I uncovered the value of a post reaction -- and then
        each specific reaction. How likely is each reaction to result in a page view
        on my website? In a registration? In a purchase?\n\nThen I used this same
        approach, but started with a post comment as the top of my funnel. Then a
        post share. Then a sent message.\n\nYou can -- and should -- do this, too.
